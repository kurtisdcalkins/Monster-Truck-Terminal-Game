# Monster-Truck-Terminal-Game
This holds the Codecademy Final Project: Python Terminal Game

This is a text-based Monster Truck Racing game. The game allows you to select from 16 pre-defined monster trucks and compete in a bracket-style racing event.

You will compete in one-vs-one racing in each racing round. You can push your truck to the limits in order to win the race, but the harder you push the truck, the more likely (and more severely) you are to damage the truck. You only have one opportunity to make a repair, so you must be strategic in how hard you push the truck and when to make the repair.

Play and I hope you have fun!
